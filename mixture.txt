Clinical Trial Mixture

Production unit
Chris wants it build properly
- send us spec
- similar to IV SACT
- start next quarter

Design spec for Chris
- standards
- us two can work with Chris to develop that


Standard of care mixtures
- we get them on standard of care request form, not filled in correctly and hard to interpret
- NK is working with UMC to design a new request form (MS form)
    - to be approved
    - pilot

    - request
        - what is the raw material (basic rule), concentration, liquid or powder, what units - first step
        - does it need to be diluted? (Base or QS Base)
            - if yes, mixture dilution required
            - is it something that they would add to the bag?
            - remove from bag and add the drug

            - most are nurse-prep mixture  
                - no consumables
                - for non-cancer (only add raw material and vehicle) - we dont want them to have to scan the water for injection
                - for clinical trials, in the future
                - consumable lists in spec (i.e. diluent) diluent not included for nurse prep
                - new dispense code is needed for production labels (currently, we use Epysis which basically tells them to get the label from Epysis)
                - total volume for infusion
                - Fixed concentration / ratio-based mixture
                    - what is the ratio
                - admin over duration
                    - in SACT, we don't put admin over times because we use these drugs in so many protocols (otherwise, IV SACT records will be hard to maintain)
                    - for SOC, okay to have buttons or defaults
                - adult
                - paeds
                    - do it with different dose, volume or mixture

                - weight restriction/ dose restriction
                - these contexts will be used to determine if we can use orderable
                    - in orderable can have different contexts (adult/paeds/etc)
                
                - drug restriction based on a particular location, i.e. in ICU (build in orderable e.g. only select this mixture when the patient is in ICU)

                Beacon - IV SACT
                Willow - SOC mixtures/ Non-cancer CT
        Thought process of build in OneNote notes (per analyst or HCM)

        The preference for orderset, therapy plan, beacon protocol -> create an orderable
        Going forward, we need to formulate strategies (do we need to create orderables?)


        MAR type and PREP type - not for non-cancer mixtures (so that it won't appear in MAR Chemo tab)
        Template type - Mixture
        Group One - if SACT, populate this. Restricts that drug from being prescribed outside the protocol.
            - Advance prep chemo - is used for advance prep reports to order ahead of times
            - for non-cancer CT drugs, no advance prep report at the meantime. It's manual communication.
        Group Three - Blueteq
        IP order defaults - as per standard build
        If vial will only be prescribed as a mixture - Mixture component only - Yes
        raw ingredient, mg, ml, ml (not vial, syringe etc)
        standard rounding table i.e. Nurse prep - use system defaults
        for Chris production - 5% deviation
        raw material - dispense code is Inpatient (standard). This may change when Chris comes up with non-cancer clinical trials
        Do not dispense - will be dependent on
            - if it's something that will only be ever be prescribed as a mixture, i.e. nurse prep, leave this blank
            - do not dispense blank unless patient could have come in with it
        Only configure buttons if it can be used on it's own (not particularly a mixture component)

        Mixture settings
        - for cancer mixture, goes to OP order help text 
        - order display name
        - QS based 
            - volume field is populated Mixture setup 1
            - calculate volume - yes
            - calculate rate - yes
            - nurse prep or if made in ward - do not put stability, and it can vary

        - Base 
            - add volume in Mixture setup 2, not in 1

            dispense components 
                - if made in productions, set to No
                - if made up in ward, set to Yes. The system tells what is dispensed from the pharmacy based on location. Nurse will prep the mixture.
        
        Read guide on Overfill mixtures
        name extension - do not use 408449
        Dispense code - TBC for standard of care, for clinical trials use Investigational med Episys
        Do not dispense - blank (always for mixture)
